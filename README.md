# Real-Time Music Recommendation: Contextualized Algorithm for Playlist Personalization
> **_NOTE:_** This README file will be updated to its proper format further in the development of the project. For now it is a copy of the english version of the SUMMARY. 

## Issues

1. The requests to the API are limited and there is no way to get any complete dataset;
2. Historic tracks only have Track Name and (One) Artist Name, therefore, getting the ID from non-unicode named tracks results in failure;
    - Exemplos:
      - [DD'2D34D2N D, DD'2D34D2N](https://open.spotify.com/track/2i5stbgx5ZOScBITQFeS8F?si=089ecd32f8d34372) (ou algo do tipo)
      - [紅蓮華](https://open.spotify.com/track/23DbzwNJSLo7nkSWjODMvY?si=c474baa56dc3499f)
      - [Я не коммунист](https://open.spotify.com/track/5z7q66tSLgt23wPtCm5z3x?si=575cdb075c6449a7)
3. Image and Sound emotion analysis is a field barely developed, the most expected part of the project is postponed;
4.
